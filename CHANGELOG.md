    - control-tasks - 2.25.0
    - widget - v1.23.0

### Attention!!!
- **This version adds the required ScyllaDB component for the control_tasks application to work (The keyspace must be the same as the control_server)**
- **First, perform an update to Chart 0.3.34, only after that proceed with the update to 0.3.35 !**
- **Migration of transaction data slices from PostgreSQL to ScyllaDB from the latest migration checkpoint.**
- **Transfer of balance cache from Redis to Scylla. It will heavily impact account trees, dashboards, formulas, triggers. If there are large trees in the environment, there will be a risk of their recalculations and storing in ScyllaDB, which will impose a heavy load on PostgreSQL in this case.**

    - realtime - 3.0.4
    - control-tasks - 2.24.0
    - widget - v1.21.0

### Attention!!!

- **First, perform an update to Chart 0.3.33, only after that proceed with the update to 0.3.34 !**
- **Migration of transaction data snapshots from PostgresQL to ScyllaDB. The lengthy migration of 65 million queries takes approximately ~4 hours.**
- **As there will be increased load on PostgresQL and the control server, it is preferable to conduct the migration outside of business hours.**

### Improvements / New Features

#### 1. The support of GET parameters in the Simulator URL has been implemented to manage the visibility of the Events page UI elements when in the switch view mode:
   - **plainMode**: true/false. If set to true, the split view on the Events page is forced regardless of user settings.
   - **focusMode**: true/false. Turns off the top panel and all the selected event tabs in the split view mode on the Events page.
   - **manageUI**. Allows to manage the following blocks:
     - **sidebar**
     - **streamsTabs**: true/false
     - **streamsControls**: true/false
     - **eventControls**: true/false
     - **eventInfo**: true/false
     - **eventTabs**: true/false is the list of tabs separated by ¬´_¬ª, for example: chat_details_attachments.

You can manage the visibility of the following tabs: Details, Info, Chat, Shared, Attachments, Accounts, Events, Actors.

Inside the manageUI, elements are separated by ¬´:¬ª, while keys and values are separated by ¬´_¬ª, for example:

```
"manageUI=eventTabs_chat_details:eventInfo_false:eventControls_false"
// The eventInfo and eventControls are turned off, tabs are reduced to chat and details"focusMode=true&manageUI=eventTabs_chat_details:eventInfo_true:eventControls_true"
//The focusMode is used to turn off all elements except those allowed in the parametermanageUI "plainMode=true&focusMode=true&manageUI=sidebar_true"
// The split view mode is activated, and all the elements are turned off except the sidebar allowed in the manageUI"manageUI=eventTabs_false"
//All the tabs are turned off
```

**Note**: When using any of the mentioned GET parameters, the type: viewActor request type is sent to the API user webhook with access to the event. This info allows Corezoid processes to determine which event is in the user focus now.
This feature comes in handy when you embed the Events page as a [widget](https://doc.simulator.company/cdu#tag/widget) into Scripts.

#### 2. The My verse page on which you can quickly access your graph with main user resources and objects in the selected workspace has been updated.
#### 3. Work with dashboards has been improved
   You can add the same account with different incomeType parameters (debit,credit) to a dashboard: select the Income type checkbox in the Legend settings section of the dashboard settings menu.
   Resizing became more convenient: Only the side that you are dragging is being resized.
   The dashboard title was removed from the dashboard expanded view.
#### 4. Transaction filter API requests have been optimized to run much faster.
#### 5. The new [signature](https://doc.simulator.company/cdu#tag/signature) component was added. The component implements a whiteboard on which you can make a drawing and save it as an image. For example, you can use it to create a client signature.

### Improvements / New Features

#### 1. When you create or edit a dashboard, you can select the default account and currency in the Account by default field of the Add chart dialog. After that, you need to select actors with the account-currency chosen pair in the Actor field to build a chart.
   Note. Default account availability for the selected actors
   If an actor you've selected has the chosen account-currency pair, it will have the account value displayed to the right of the Account field (1). If the selected actor doesn't have the chosen account-currency pair, the "i" info icon will be displayed to the right of the Account field (2), informing that you must select an actor with the account-currency pair set by default.

#### 2. The dashboard widget now has the Settings dropdown menu where you can select an interval and switch the account and account value type (amount or count of transactions), thus viewing the same dashboard for different accounts.
   Note. Settings for dashboards with no Account by default selected
   On the dashboards with no Account by default selected, the Settings menu allows selecting a time interval and switching between the amount and transaction count values.
   The Settings menu configuration does not affect the dashboard creation/editing menu configuration.
#### 3. The feature of creating dynamic dashboards based on actor filters was added. To create a dynamic dashboard, in the Dashboard type field of the Add chart dialog, select Dynamic by ActorFilters.
   After creating this dashboard type:
   - Select the specific filter you want to use to build your dashboard in the Select Actors Filters dropdown list.
   Note: The selected Actor Filter must have an account to build a dashboard.
   - Select the Top number that defines the number of top actor accounts from the filter range, which values will be displayed on the dashboard.
   You can't build a Line chart type with the Dynamic by ActorFilters dashboard type
#### 4. Now, you can add images and gifs anywhere in the text when editing an event or actor description, which makes editing big event descriptions easier. With that, the cursor maintains a correct position.
#### 5. API methods for getting account names were optimized.

#### 6. Improved readability of actors and connections on the graph:
   - Increased the size of actors on the graph
   - Enhanced the contrast of connections between actors
   - Added a background to the title of actors

#### 7. Scripts: Now, with each /get and /send request, a new parameter sessionData.fingerprint is included.
   The fingerprint is provided independently of the script authorization settings. This parameter can be used as a session ID.

#### 8. Enabled the ability to perform transfers on the graph.
   To initiate a transfer, hover over the connection between actors, and a "+" sign will appear.
   Click on the "+" sign, and in the transfer creation form, specify the amount and, if necessary, switch the sender and receiver.
   Transfers are executed based on the account selected in the layer settings.
   If any of the selected actors do not have an account, it will be automatically opened.
   If there are transfers between two actors added to the layer on the selected account, they are displayed as green arrows. The thicker the arrow, the larger the transfer amount. The amount is calculated relative to all transfers on this layer.

#### 9. Added support for the "filter" parameter in all GET methods for transactions.
   https://control.events/api.html#tag/transactions
   It is recommended to use it for response size optimization.

#### 10. Add new component ScyllaDB

#### 6. By using the API Filter actors by form method, you can sort actors by any field: the request gets the orderByKey field where you have to enter the key to make a sorting. For more information, go to [Filters actors](https://control.events/api.html#operation/filterActors)
#### 7. The redesigned transfer details page allows you to see the details of changes against text and actor ID accounts that occurred within a transfer.
#### 8. On Dashboard charts, you can see the values for each part.
#### 9. The display of the Events page and all your events‚Äô details are a better fit for your mobile device browsers.
#### 10. Localization support was added. In the locale file, you can configure your localization

```
{
 "legacy": "–ó–≤–æ—Ä–æ—Ç–Ω—è —Å—É–º—ñ—Å–Ω—ñ—Å—Ç—å",
 "label": {
   "en": "Hello page",
   "uk": "–ü—Ä–∏–≤—ñ—Ç —Å—Ç–æ—Ä—ñ–Ω–∫–∞"
 }
}
```

Where: uk and en are the keys with any value; you can have any number of such keys.The old keys remain operable as before.To use a particular localization language, you need to send the language parameter together with the language value from Corezoid in response to the /get request. For more information, go to Get page https://control.events/script.html#tag/get-page  and Locale.
#### 11. The protocol for working with widget commands from scripts that run in the widget has been changed:

```
{
"data": {
    "ctrl": [
        {
            "namespace": "webWidget",
            "method": "close"
        }
    ]
},
"code": 200
}
```

#### 12. In the Actor filter, you can filter actors by account balance:
   Select an account and enter the needed values to the Balance from and Balance to fields.
   (Optional) Select the needed sorting in the Sort by dropdown list.
   As a result, you can see the list of actors with the Account-Currency column displaying the selected account balances for actors.
#### 13. In the Edit Chart dialog, you can:
   Customize the colors for your chart by entering the needed color codes.
   Regenerate all colors by clicking the refresh icon next to the Color field to set random colors for each part of your chart.
   Note: The Use actors colors option has been removed.
#### 14. The calculation of balances in account trees has been optimized.
#### 15. Enabled the ability to embed events into scripts without unnecessary components.

###  Scripts

#### 1. You can use the mapping functionality when importing scripts: If the file that you are importing has at least one script, when mapping, the Corezoid credentials tab appears where you can specify new corresponding credentials for each script. This feature simplifies the import of scripts and makes it possible to use them immediately after the import is complete.
#### 2. The following components have the context menu:
   Button: options are described in extra.options.
   For more information, go to [Button](https://control.events/script.html#tag/button).
   Table: options are described in body[].options[].button.extra.options.
   For more information, go to [Table](https://control.events/script.html#tag/table).

#### 5. You can use the new Line type for dashboards that shows the dynamics of transactions (amount and number) of selected accounts.
#### 6. The Total transfer type has been added to the Make transfer form and is made available for the Numeric account type. For the String and Account ID account types, use the Debit and Credit types. When making a transfer with the Total type selected:
   A positive debit transaction is made against the actor account selected in the Actor from field.
   A positive credit transaction is made against the actor account selected in the Actor to field.
   Note: When you select the Total type in the Actor from line, the Type field in the Actor to line gets disabled.
#### 7. On the Events page:
   - You now have the counter of the number of unread messages in the chat list on the open Conversation panel and in your chats where you need to scroll to see new messages.
   - To send a message in a chat, you have a new option to send a message in a chat by pressing Enter on your keyboard.
   - The events are not grouped by the View and Freeze user reactions anymore.
#### 8. In the form constructor, you can collapse a large list of fields with the manual options source.
#### 9. You can visualize connections between actors based on their transfer history. To view these connections, simply add actors to the layer and in the upper-right corner, select the account-currency pair:
   - The direction of the arrow shows the transfer source and recipient.
   - The captions on the arrow displays the total amount and number of transfers made.
   - The arrow thickness depends on the total transfers amount.
#### 10. In the actor‚Äôs change history, you can:
   - Quickly switch between the history periods by clicking the arrows next to the period
   - View the correct representation of changes when the actor‚Äôs data type is JSON
#### 11. On the dashboards:
   - You can specify the Y-Axis label for the Bar and Line charts in the Edit Chart form.
   - You can specify the number rounding method (decimal positions after comma) in the settings of the account-currency pair.
   - When resizing, the chart fits completely into the selected frame displaying the full legend, without the need to scroll and crop.
#### 12. For actors-images, a title is no longer displayed on a graph, only an image.
#### 13. For the Create transfer API method, the finance type has been added:
   - All the accounts with the finance from must be debit.
   - All the accounts with the finance to must be credit.
   - The amount must be positive for all accounts.
For more information, go to Create transfer.
#### 14. The Create transaction method has been improved: the addValues and delValues parameters have been added to the String and Actor ID account types. For more information, go to Create transaction.
#### 15. Account trees and formula calculations are now performed asynchronously, and the derived balances are stored in the database.
This improvement reduces system load when handling account balances generated by a tree or formula, enabling smoother utilization of these accounts on dashboards
#### 16. The selection of an account-currency pair on graph layers was simplified by implementing a unified component that combines account and currency selection into one operation.
#### 17. Now all drop-down lists in the actor structure have an additional option to delete values, which provides more flexibility and data management control.
#### 18. The Export & Import functionality has been improved:
   - If the Export accounts with transactions and transfers checkbox is not selected, the accounts are exported and imported with 0 balance correspondingly.
   - The import of TransactionFilters and Dashboards actors has been refined, replacing the account-currency pairs with new ones during the import.

###  Scripts
#### 1. In the Widgets form, you have two new fields: Start and Final. If the scripts are selected in the actor‚Äôs widget settings:
   - The Start script is launched automatically when the dialogue starts.
   - The Final script is launched automatically when the dialogue is closed.
#### 2. You can set the modal window size by using styles
#### 3. You can load faster script pages that don‚Äôt have dynamic content without sending a request to Corezoid: Right-click the needed page, and then select Make static page. The static pages are marked with the S letter
#### 4. You can use styles for the calendar component and table elements. For more information, go to Style.
#### 5. For the public API, baseURL has been changed: https://api.simulator.company/v/1.0. Though the old baseURL will be supported for some time, we recommend changing the current baseUrl with the new one in your Processes as soon as possible.
Note: This does not affect the clients who use In-House Simulator.Company versions.
#### 6. For the sidebar component, the Skill bar type has been added. For more information, go to Slider.

### Fixed Issues
#### 1. Adding two variables in one key via the viewModel method failed: Now, you can use the "value": "{{amount currency"}} template to add two variables in one key.
#### 2. Calendar component: You can easily select the period in the calendar component throughout the system.
#### 3. Automatic snippet search: When entering first name characters in the Comment field, the list of snippets with corresponding names appears.
#### 4. Push notifications on new events and reactions within events have been improved in the browser. Notifications now have a consistent display, providing a universal look for both push notifications and internal notifications.
#### 5. The handling of user and actor tags in actor descriptions and reactions has been optimized.

#### 16. The Import & Export feature has been upgraded: Now, all types of connections are exported and imported along with the actor, making data management even more comprehensive.

### Scripts
#### 1. You can embed dashboards into scripts using the widget component. `extra.widgetUrl` must be formed this way: `{{{simulatorEnvUrl}/dashboard/{accId}/view/{actorId}}}`, where:
##### a. `simulatorEnvUrl` is your Simulator‚Äôs URL (for example, https://admin.control.events).
##### b. `accId` is your Workspace ID.
##### c. `actorId` is your dashboard actor ID.
#### 2. Use the modalHeader array for modal type sections. If the array isn't empty, the standard modal close cross won't be displayed, allowing you to customize the modal header and track cross clicks in your Process


## [0.3.27] - 2023-10-04
### Helm changes
- Applications versions:
    - server - 5.34.0
    - frontend - 5.34.1
    - realtime - 3.0.4
    - control-tasks - 2.14.0
    - widget - v1.8.0

### Improvements

#### 1. Added new functionality Filters in Events
   Filters are applied based on the event creation date and event owner.
   The filter can be applied to all events (All stream) and within a specific stream.
   The filter resets when the Events section is closed or when the page is refreshed.

#### 2. Improved Import/Export functionality. Now, all actor relationships with the hierarchy type are exported and imported along with the actors.

#### 3. Added a new attachment component. Suitable for simultaneous uploading of multiple files. https://control.events/script.html#tag/attachment

#### 4. Increased the maximum file size that can be uploaded to the cloud version to 100 MB. https://admin.control.events/

#### 1. Fixed the display of the API key avatar in the chat widget.

#### 2. Fixed bulk tag replacement in the settings for the Currency_Account pair.

#### 3. Fixed the formation of the sessionData object for SSO users, which is sent to the script process receiver. Now, the sessionData structure is consistent with what is sent for users with other types of authorization.


## [0.3.26] - 2023-09-27
### Helm changes
- Applications versions:
    - server - 5.33.0
    - frontend - 5.33.0
    - realtime - 3.0.4
    - control-tasks - 2.13.0
    - widget - v1.7.0

### Improvements

#### 1. New types of accounts have been introduced: String and Actor ID, and the Accounts page in the actor's panel has been redesigned.
#### 2. Improved the display of icons on user avatars through the API. They now appear in all places in the Simulator.
#### 3. Added a new section in the Simulator - Outer Graph.
   Outer Graph is a public graph where any company (workspace) owner can configure their company's card and publish it to the public graph for interaction with clients and partners.
#### 4. Implemented the opening of custom actor creation forms through the Actors bag.
   If a system form is selected when creating an actor in the Actors bag:
   Dashboards, TransfersFilter, AccountTriggers, ActorFilters, TransactionFilters
   Then a non-standard custom form will automatically open for these forms, as this form is specific to each of these types of actors.
#### 5. Dashboards improvements:
##### 5.1. In the dashboard constructor, the ability to sort accounts on the chart has been added.
##### 5.2. In the dashboard constructor, the ability to configure a legend that will be displayed on the chart has been added.
#### 6. In the mobile version, a "Make transfer" button has been added to the main screen for quick transfer creation from a smartphone or tablet.
#### 7. Import/export:
   Made it possible to import without deleted objects in the actor's data.
   If there are deleted objects in the actor's data:
   Objects: actors, currencies, actor names
   They are deleted from the structure during export, and the export is done without these fields. Accordingly, during import, these fields will not be present in the actor's model.
#### 8. Optimized the API for retrieving transactions and transfers. Response time has significantly decreased.

### Scripts:
#### 1. Added functionality for auto-submit for the Button component.
   https://control.events/script.html#tag/button
   extra.autoSubmit

   body[].clickable

### Bug Fixes:
#### 1. Fixed a case where it was impossible to revoke access rights to an actor for a user.
#### 2. Fixed a bug where custom actor colors were not saved when creating a new actor.
#### 3. Fixed the display of the select component. Sometimes, an empty space was added at the end of the list.


## [0.3.25] - 2023-09-06
### Helm changes
- Add `apiGateway` parameter in `server` configmap
- Applications versions:
   - server - 5.30.0
   - frontend - 5.30.0
   - realtime - 3.0.3
   - control-tasks - 2.11.2
   - widget - v1.5.0

#### Improvements
#### 1. Implemented dashboard functionality.
Dashboards are graphical panels with data sources that include account balances or the number of transactions on them. Dashboards can be displayed as charts on graphs. Dashboard chart is an actor in the Dashboards system form.

How to add/create a chart:
##### 1.1. In the Actors bag, create an actor in the system form: Dashboards.
##### 1.2. Click the "Add chart" button on the layer.
##### 1.3. On the graph, use lasso to select actors, choose "Add chart," and a chart will be automatically created using the selected account_currency pair on this graph (top right). You can then edit and refine this dashboard.

 - Title: Dashboard name
 - Chart type: Bar, Line, Pie, Doughnut, Funnel, Table
 - Period by default: The dashboard will be generated by default for the selected period, which can be changed on the chart itself.
 - Account value type:
 - Count of transactions: The dashboard will display the count of transactions on the selected accounts.
 - Account amount: The dashboard will display balances on the selected account: debit, credit, or total.
 - Actor: Up to 20 accounts can be added for display on a single dashboard. You can also change the position of the account using drag-and-drop, affecting its placement on the dashboard.
 - Use actor's color: If checked, the dashboard will use actor colors; if not, random colors from the library will be used for dashboard construction.
 - Display the total: If checked, the dashboard will display the total, which is the automatically calculated sum of all added metrics. If not checked, the total will not be displayed.

#### 2. Added the ability to export transactions and transfers along with accounts.
   This is an optional feature configured in the Import & Export section -> Export -> Edit (on an already formed selection). Check the "Export accounts with transactions and transfers" option.
#### 3. Implemented an error page. In case the service is not working, the user will be directed to this page with the option to refresh it.
#### 4. Set the default graph and layer name based on the name of the first actor added to the layer.
#### 5. Improved the rename function throughout the system.
#### 6. Added a search function for extra parameters in the transaction list interface.
#### 7. Enabled customization of actor images added to the graph. To do this, go to the contextual menu of the actor-image on the graph -> Customize image. Available actions include changing opacity, bringing to the front or sending to the back, and resizing.
#### 8. Added an "Invite users" button in the left sidebar for quick user collaboration.
#### 9. Added an API icon for users. Now, near the API user's avatar in any part of the system, a mini API icon is displayed to quickly visually distinguish regular users from API users.
#### 10. Scripts: Added support for the "skipSubmitOnChange" parameter to all components that support "submitOnChange." To ignore the next "submitOnChange," set "skipSubmitOnChange": true in the changes for the relevant component. To stop ignoring, set "skipSubmitOnChange": false. After ignoring a submit, the component will work in standard mode.
#### 11. Implemented the ability to export the entire workspace. This can be done in the Import & Export section. Workspace export is available for roles Owner and Admin. It exports all entities in the workspace without additional access rights checks. The generated file will be no different from the one formed during partial export and can be imported into another workspace or environment.
#### 12. Improved export considering the case when deleted actors are present in the data of an actor. Now, in such cases, there will be no error, and the export will proceed based on the "as is" principle, and it will be imported the same way.
#### 13. Bugfix: Fixed a bug where file export failed due to permissions granted to a group.
#### 14. Bugfix: Fixed UI bugs in the actor card constructor and its display on the graph.


## [0.3.24] - 2023-08-19
### Helm changes
- Add `apiGateway` parameter in `server` configmap
- Applications versions:
    server - 5.27.2
    frontend - 5.27.0
    realtime - 3.0.3
    control-tasks - 2.8.0
    widget - v1.4.0

#### Improvements
[Release notes Simulator (5.25.0)](https://doc.corezoid.com/docs/simulator-5250) 02.08.2023
1. Implemented the Actor card view functionality. You can configure the actor card on the actor creation/edit form under the "Actors Card" tab. In the constructor, you can specify what information from the actor will be displayed on the card. Available options include:

Avatar
Preview of any selected layer
Account balances (up to 3)
Actor fields (up to 2)
Actor description
+ You can add a button that will trigger a selected online chat widget.
To open an actor's card on the graph, select "Show actor card" from the context menu. This way, for selected actors, their card can be displayed on the graph, providing more informative content than just avatar + title.
2. Implemented graph loading from cache. While synchronization of changes is ongoing, the graph is available in read-only mode. After synchronization is complete, the graph can be edited. This is done to speed up the loading of large graphs.
3. Started adding actor change history:
Event about sharing rights during actor creation.
The initial value of a field.
Scripts
1. Added the ability to embed a comments widget in scripts.
To do this:

In the script constructor, add the actorId of the comments widget to the widgets file:
```
{ "ctrlSettings": Unknown macro: \{ "webComments"}
}
```

To add the comments widget to a page, add a widget component of type webComments. [Script Widget Documentation](https://control.events/script.html#tag/widget)
2. Introduced a new OTP component - [OTP Component Documentation](https://control.events/script.html#tag/otp)


[Release notes Simulator (5.26.0)](https://doc.corezoid.com/docs/simulator-5260) 09.08.2023
1. Added a progress bar when adding images to a layer.

Bugfix
1. Fixed an issue with duplicating actors when moving them between layers.
2. Fixed the display of dropdown lists when they were hidden behind a form. They should now open above the form.


[Release notes Simulator (5.27.2)](https://doc.corezoid.com/docs/simulator-5270) 19.08.2023
1. Implemented an API endpoint for uploading base64-encoded images:
`/upload/base64/{accId}`
Input data example:

```
{ "file": "iVBORw0KGgoA...", "originalName": "fileName.png" }
```

2. Enabled the ability to edit currencies for all users who have the permission `ACCOUNTS_MANAGEMENT` in the single space.

Bugfix
1. Fixed a case where sharing did not work when cloning an actor if a participant was removed from the workspace.
2. Fixed errors that occurred when editing a transaction filter.
3. Fixed email sending when creating a new event in https://admin.control.events/.


## [0.3.23] - 2023-07-26
### Helm changes
- Switch to a public `redis` image
- Add new parameter to `opentelemetry` - `enabled: false|true` to off|on tracing (view values.yaml -> opentelemetry)
- Chage `initialDelaySeconds` for server `readinessProbe` and `livenessProbe`
- Applications versions:
    server - 5.24.0
    frontend - 5.24.0
    realtime - 3.0.1
    control-tasks - 2.5.1
    widget - v1.1.1

#### Improvements
1. Created a comments widget. Instructions for use: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bAmjjej__DSSnCza1rqQ5L-_zWGlkFXR/view

2. Export/Import. In the form builder, as a data source for dropdown and multiselect fields, you can choose "Account names" and "Currencies." We improved the export functionality to recursively fetch accounts and currencies during the export process, and after importing, they are replaced with the corresponding newly created accounts and currencies in the actors.

3. Moved starred events from the sidebar menu to the system stream named "Starred."

4. Implemented recursive updating of account balances based on formulas. If there is a chain of dependent formulas, updating the balance at the bottom account will trigger updates for all dependent formula balances in the chain going upwards.

5. Implemented the functionality for transfers. This can be found in the "Transfers" section under the "Simulator" menu. A transfer allows moving funds from one actor's account to the account(s) of one or more other actors (with a limit of 20 recipients per split). For a transfer to be successful, all transactions generated by the transfer must be carried out atomically. If at least one transaction fails (e.g., due to a limit on the account), the transfer will not occur. Transfers are only possible between accounts with the same currency. In the "Transfers" section, you can create transfers, view the list of transfers, apply quick filters, or configure and pin more complex ones. It's also possible to view all details of a specific transfer.

6. Added the "transferId" field in the "transactions" section. If the field is not empty, it indicates that the transaction was generated by a transfer.

7. Renamed the "Bets" section to "Events" and correspondingly "bet" to "event."

8. Developed the backend for account balance-based dashboards. This functionality will be available in upcoming releases.

Scripts:
1. Added a response protocol to the sync API with code 205. In response to "/send," it is now possible to specify the command "redraw the page with the new viewModel" without refreshing the page completely. This implementation allows for restructuring and replacing the contentLoop of the page. https://control.events/script.html#tag/send-form
2. Fixed a bug that prevented real-time functionality from working after switching to the nextPage.

2. Added a Style section to the documentation - https://control.events/script.html#tag/style - providing an example of how to change the color theme for your script. Also added CSS support to components that previously did not have it.
3. Added input mask support for the Edit component.
4. Added a script protocol parameter for controlling the opening of external links (in a new or current tab).
5. Enabled the execution of changes on submit for any forms on the page. (Previously, changes could only be made to the form on which the submit occurred). The changes object should include a formId parameter for executing such changes.
Example:
```
{
  "code": 200,
  "data": {
    "changes": [
      {
        "id": "componentId",
        "formId": "anotherFormId",
        "visibility": "hidden"
      }
    ]
  }
}

    frontend - 5.19.0
    realtime - 2.0.0
    control-tasks - 2.2.0
    widget - v1.0.47

#### Improvements
1. Implemented Triggers functionality.
Triggers are used to receive signals (via webhook API Key) about reaching target balances or transaction counts on accounts.
A Trigger is an actor created in the system as AccountTriggers.
A Trigger can be applied to an account balance or transaction count, as well as total, debit, or credit.
A Trigger can have an end date, which is the date after which the trigger conditions will no longer be checked.
A Trigger can be checked periodically.
Triggers are divided into three zones: lower, normal, and upper. The zone settings are controlled by the parameters: Lower target value and Upper target value.
Once a change in the zone occurs, corresponding to a change in the account balance or transaction count, a webhook with type "trigger" is sent with signal details.
Triggers are added only to the accountName_currency pair. Therefore, any actor associated with that pair will have the trigger applied.
To use a Trigger, access needs to be granted to the API key for the accountName_currency pair and the Trigger actor.
In the interface, the trigger history can be viewed. To access the history, click on the Trigger history icon next to the accountName_currency parameter added to the actor. Alternatively, select the Trigger history section in the Trigger actor's menu.
In the history, the delivery status of the webhook can be viewed, along with the details that were sent, and the signal can be resent.

2. Increased the limit for sending atomic transactions to 20 per request. https://control.events/api.html#operation/createTransactionAtomic

3. Optimized/improved the search for actors and forms in the interface.

4. Implemented a balance display format - seconds. It can be configured in the accountName_currency pair creation/edit interface.
The account balance is converted to seconds.
For example:
Balance: 100 - Displayed as 1 min 40 sec
Balance: 3600 - Displayed as 1 hour
Balance: 86,401 - Displayed as 1 day 1 sec

5. Updated the component for working with emojis in the interface and fixed bugs related to emoji usage.

6. Added a method description for creating an accountName_currency pair to the documentation. https://control.events/api.html#operation/postAccounts

Scripts:
1. Modified the settings for authorization of anonymous users to allow embedding the anonymous script (Anyone with the link) as an iFrame on any websites.

2. Implemented the ability to customize the preloader on scripts using CSS:
.progressBar

{ color: red !important; }

Widget:
1. Added the ability to pass the real IP address of the user accessing via the widget in the meta info.

2. Implemented a callback system for the widget events:

When the messenger is opened, you can hook into the event using the following function argument:
```
ctrl('webWidget', 'onOpen', function() { // Do stuff }
);
```

When the messenger is closed, you can hook into the event using the following function argument:
```
ctrl('webWidget', 'onClose', function() { // Do stuff }
);
```


## [0.3.19] - 2023-06-08
### Helm changes
- Applications versions:
    server - 5.17.0
    frontend - 5.17.2
    realtime - 2.0.0
    control-tasks - 2.1.0
    widget - v1.0.45

- `Cron` application is deprecated in current helm version. Before `helm upgrade ...` in values file set `.Values.global.control.cron.app_enabled` to `false`.
- Reatime: Add port for metrics. Can set `.Values.global.control.realtimeMetricsPort` or will be use default port `9100`
- Ingress: Add
```
more_set_headers X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
more_set_headers X-Forwarded-For $http_x_forwarded_for;
```
for forward real user IP in widget.

#### Improvements
1. We have implemented the functionality for group actions on Accounts.

In the Accounts section, you can select multiple accounts and grant access rights to all pairs associated with these accounts in bulk. Please note that access will only be granted to those pairs for which you have the Edit permission.
If you navigate inside a specific Account, you can select multiple pairs and mass assign access rights to them or manage tags for these pairs in bulk.
2. We have introduced access rules mapping during the import of .graph files.
This feature allows you to inherit the access rights that were present in the exported file onto users and groups within the workspace where the import is being performed.
Mapping can be performed in a one-to-many manner.

3. In all sections where group actions are available, we have implemented the Multiple choice feature using the Shift key.

4. We have developed a real-time expiration script for scripts running in events.

5. We have added the functionality to drag and drop images onto the graph.

6. We have replaced the control-crons service with control-tasks. This service is responsible for executing asynchronous tasks. It is more optimized than its predecessor.

7. Added a comment stream on the graph:

Layer's reactions: reactions related to the layer itself.
Comment area: a stream of events with their comments created on this layer using the lasso tool.
To open the stream, click on the "Stream" button on the bottom panel while on any layer.
7.1. When creating an event using the lasso tool, a modal window now opens with a standard event creation form. This allows us to manage access rights to different events on the same layer.

8. Added the ability to quickly switch between periods in transaction filters in the Transactions section. Switching is done using the < or > arrows. For example, if a 30-day period is selected and the arrow is pressed, the period will change forward or backward by 30 days in a single click, and the corresponding data list will be loaded.

9. Added an API method to retrieve accounts for a list of actors.

10. Implemented the backend for triggers on accounts. The functionality will be available in the next release on production.

11. Fixed a bug.

Scripts:
1. In the notifications component, we have enabled line breaks in notifications.

2. Added tooltip support as a property for components like labels and buttons. https://control.events/script.html#tag/label

3. Implemented real-time functionality in Scripts:
How it works: The server (Corezoid) can call the public API to send a real-time package of changes to a specific user on a specific script page.
Any changes supported by the script protocol can be passed in real-time, including changes, notifications, and ctrl.
Example request:
POST
{baseUrl}/pages/realtime/{scriptActorId}/{env}/{page}

baseUrl: The host of the public API (e.g., https://api.control.events/v/1.0)
scriptActorId: The actorId of the script
env: production or develop
page: The identifier of the page (e.g., index)

Body:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "changes": [
            {
                "id": "component-id",
                "formId": "info"
            }
        ],
        "notifications": [
            {
                "title": "t1",
                "type": "success"
            }
        ],
        "ctrl": [
            ["q", "w"]
        ]
    },
    "receivers": [
        {
            "userId": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

 - changes: Follows the protocol specified at documentation https://control.events/script.html#operation/sendForm. The difference is that the formId parameter is required in each object. This allows making changes to any form on the same page using real-time.
 - notifications: Follows the protocol specified at
 - ctrl: Follows the protocol specified
 - receivers[].userId: Retrieved from requests: `sessionData.userInfo.id`. Multiple active script users can be targeted with a single request.

The response to the request will always be 'ok', even if the client did not receive the package of changes. For example, if the browser tab is closed or the user is already on another page.

*The user's API must have access to scriptActorId to execute these requests.*

Widget:
1. Removed the display of reactions (Signed, Done, Rate) in the widget. The corresponding text messages are now displayed instead of labels.
2. Removed the automatic zoom-in of the chat widget when opened on iOS.

## [0.3.18] - 2023-05-31
### Helm changes
- New applications versions:
    server/cron - 5.15.2
    frontend - 5.15.1
    realtime - 2.0.0
    widget - v1.0.43

#### Improvements
1. Implemented actor copying functionality.
1.1. The Actors bag provides 2 options:
Make copy: creates a single copy of an actor.
Multiple copy: specifies the number of copies, from 1 to 50, and launches an asynchronous process to create the required number of copies.
1.2. Scripts: Only the Make copy option is available, which also copies the script content (pages, config, locale) and Corezoid process connection parameters.
1.3. Communications: Only the Make copy option is available, working similarly to the Actors bag.
When creating a copy of an actor, its ref, links, access rights, and attachments are not copied.
However, the access rights from the form will be inherited, as in the normal actor creation conditions.
2. By default, when granting access rights to workspace objects to the workspace owner, all access rights are given.
3. Added functionality to create a new workspace from the Simulator interface, without switching to Single space.
4. Updated the Manage access rules form. The Done button is inactive until Add is pressed.
5. Bug fix implemented.

Widget
1. Implemented functionality to confirm that the conversation will not be anonymous:
If a user accesses the chat widget installed on any website and already has an active session in that browser at https://admin.control.events/, they will see a window where they can choose to:

Start an anonymous conversation
Start a conversation under the current account
This determines how the user profile will be displayed in the operator's admin panel (anonymously or not).
2. Styled the system button "New Conversation" to match the widget's color.
3. Added support for SSO authentication in the widget. Instructions for usage will be available in the upcoming documentation releases.
4. Fixed a bug with chat activation on certain screen resolutions of mobile devices.
Scripts
1. Added hotkeys for undo/redo in the script editor.
2. Implemented backend support for real-time script execution. The functionality will be available in upcoming versions.
3. Bug fix implemented.


## [0.3.17] - 2023-05-25
### Helm changes
- New applications versions:
    server/cron - 5.14.0
    frontend - 5.14.1
    control-tasks - 1.0.13
    realtime - 1.1.6

- Add new parameter `.Values.global.control.cron.app_enabled` for future switch from `cron` to `tasks` (need add to values file with `true` value, e.g. `app_enabled: true`).
- Add new parameter `Values.global.control.server.allow_autotests` for future autotest (no change in `values.yaml` need)

#### Improvements
 1. In the Actors bag settings form, a new field called "owner" has been added to the filters. This allows filtering actors based on their owner.
 In the public API "actors_filter," a new field called "ownerId" has been added.
 2. Transactions now include additional fields: "account_hold_amount" and "available_amount," providing more details about the transaction.
 3. The default size of the actor's sidebar panel has been increased. There is no longer a horizontal scroll on the tabs.
 4. Various bug fixes and optimizations have been implemented, resulting in improvements and enhancements.


## [0.3.16] - 2023-04-03
### Helm changes
- New applications versions:
    server/cron - 5.12.0
    frontend - 5.12.1
    control-tasks - 1.0.11
    widget - v1.0.42


## [0.3.15] - 2023-04-03
### Helm changes
- New applications versions:
    server/cron - 5.12.0
    frontend - 5.12.1
    control-tasks - 1.0.11
    widget - v1.0.42

- Add new block in `control-tasks` to work with `http` protocol (use `https://` by default):
```
"protocol": "{{ .Values.control.protocol | default "https://" }}"
```
- Add new block in `control-tasks` to work with insecure ssl certificate (use `false` by default):
```
"insecure_skip_verify": "{{ .Values.control.insecure_skip_verify | default "false" }}"
```
- Add files `monitoring.yaml` for tasks, frontend, realtime, server templates and defines for future monitoring.

#### Improvements
1. User profile functionality has been implemented to establish communication between any actor in the workspace and the user. In the left sidebar, a Profile section has been added, which is a system layer of an actor associated with the user. By default, it is a default actor without custom parameters.
To change the association of the user with an actor, you need to enter the edit mode of any actor, toggle the Optional fields switch, and fill in the Single account user field. This field displays all the users in the workspace.
The following conditions must be met to perform the association change operation:
- The user making the changes must have the "The right to modify system actors" permission in the Single space.
- The user must have the rights to modify the actor they want to associate with the user.
At any given time, one user can only be associated with one actor.
In places where users are displayed (such as the list of users shared on an object or the object owner), it is now possible to click on a user. If the actor associated with the user is accessible, it will open that actor. If there are no permissions, a short card with system information will be displayed.
1.1. A display mode for any actor has been added to the "Profile" graph. Profile allows for displaying an actor's card directly on the graph without opening the sidebar.
To open an actor as a Profile, you need to right-click on the actor on the graph and select the "Expand profile" option.
2. REF has been added for forms. REF is necessary for future form merging, and it is more convenient to work with than using ID when versioning processes.
3. The ability to search for actors in the Actors bag by actor REF has been implemented. Simply enter the actor REF in the search bar.
4. While configuring sharing for a group, the participant count has become clickable. Clicking on it displays a list of all participants.
5. In the Forms section, a search by form ID has been added.
6. An API method has been implemented for deleting files. https://control.events/api.html#operation/removeAttachment
If a file is attached to an actor, it cannot be deleted directly. First, the actor must be deleted.
7. The filter query parameter has been added to the following methods: https://control.events/api.html#operation/getLinked and https://control.events/api.html#operation/getLinkedActors
8. Formula-related issues have been fixed:
- The balance of an account with a formula now updates on the graph.
- The balance of an account with a formula updates without the need to re-save the formula.
9. Fixed a bugs.

#### Widget:
1. The size of user avatars in the widget has been increased.
2. The size of the text input field in the widget has been increased to accommodate up to 5 lines.

#### Widget:
1. The select component, type: autocomplete, has been improved. A 0.5-second delay has been added after text input completion before sending a "send" request to Corezoid.

#### Improvements
1. Created user Groups.
1.1. Purpose of groups: for more convenient and fast management of access rights to system objects.
1.2. How to work with groups:
1.1.1. Groups can be created and users added to them in Single Space -> Groups.
1.1.2. When sharing access rights to any objects in the system, it is now possible to choose individual users or groups.
1.1.3. Access rights are merged if a user is in multiple groups or added separately.
1.1.4. API Keys can be added to groups.
1.1.5. If a user is added to a group, all objects in the system shared with that group will immediately become available to them.
2. Added the ability to configure a filter in the Actors bag interface based on the updatedAt field.
3. Added the ability to filter actors only by nested forms (based on the presence of some nested form in the actor).
4. Implemented real-time event addition to the stream based on the "creation of a link between actor-event and actor-stream" trigger.
5. We have resolved bugs

- Add possibility to set redis database - `.Values.global.control.redisDb` - set from 0 to 15 (default: 0 )

#### Improvements
1. Added a new section called "Transactions". This is a separate interface for working with transactions:
On the main screen, there is the ability to apply quick filters by period, account name and currency pair, account type and actors. There is also the ability to search for transactions by reference, comment or transaction ID.
By clicking on "+", a custom filter can be created and pinned to tabs (similar to Actros bag).
For any transaction from the list, you can click on it and go to its separate page to view details and share a direct link with someone.
Updated the "Make transactions" form.
2. Removed the "AllTime" option from the API request for getting the list of transactions. If no "from" and "to" parameters are passed in the request, the result will be for the last month of activity on the account.
3. Optimized the API request for searching actors by title and description.
